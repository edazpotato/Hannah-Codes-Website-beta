<h2 >Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to Me. It is hannah codes&#39; policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information I or vercel may collect about you, including across My website, <a href="https://hannahcodes.co.uk">https://hannahcodes.co.uk</a>, and other sites I own and operate. </p>

<h3>Information I Collect</h3>
<p>Information I or vercel collect includes both information you knowingly and actively provide Me when using or participating in any of My services and promotions, and any information automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing My products and services. </p>

<h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>When I collect and process personal information, and while I retain this information, I will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. </p>
<p>Although I will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to Me, I advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. I will comply with laws applicable to Me in respect of any data breach. </p>
<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of My services. </p>
<h4>How Long I Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
