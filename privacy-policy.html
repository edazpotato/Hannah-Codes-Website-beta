   <h1 class="pfptext"> Privacy Policy </h1>
  </div>

<div class="termtext">
<p>Your privacy is important to Me. It is hannah codes&#39; policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information I or vercel may collect about you, including across My website, <a href="https://hannahcodes.co.uk">https://hannahcodes.co.uk</a>, and other sites I own and operate. </p>
<p>This policy is effective as of 3 March 2021 and was last updated on 3 March 2021. </p>
<h3>Information I Collect</h3>
<p>Information I or vercel collect includes both information you knowingly and actively provide Me when using or participating in any of My services and promotions, and any information automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing My products and services. </p>
<h4>Log Data</h4>
<p>When you visit My website, vercel servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. It may include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, other details about your visit, and technical details that occur in conjunction with any errors you may encounter. </p>
<p>Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons. </p>
<h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
<p>I or vercel may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on My website: </p>
<ul>
   <li>Use a mobile device or web browser to access My content</li>

   <li>When you mention Me on social media</li>
</ul>
<p>I may collect, hold, use, and disclose information for the following purposes, and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes: </p>
<p>Please be aware that I may combine information I collect about you with general information or research data I receive from other trusted sources. </p>
<h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>When I collect and process personal information, and while I retain this information, I will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. </p>
<p>Although I will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to Me, I advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security. I will comply with laws applicable to Me in respect of any data breach. </p>
<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of My services. </p>
<h4>How Long I Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
<p>I keep your personal information only for as long as I need to. This time period may depend on what I are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. If your personal information is no longer required, I will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. </p>
<p>However, if necessary, I may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. </p>
<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>I do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13. </p>
<h3>International Transfers of Personal Information</h3>
<p>The personal information I collect is stored and/or processed where I or My partners, affiliates, and third-party providers maintain facilities. Please be aware that the locations to which I store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. If I transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries: (i) I will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of applicable law; and (ii) I will protect the transferred personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. </p>
<h3>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>You always retain the right to withhold personal information from Me, with the understanding that your experience of My website may be affected. I will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights over your personal information. If you do provide Me with personal information you understand that I will collect, hold, use and disclose it in accordance with this privacy policy. You retain the right to request details of any personal information I hold about you. </p>
<p>If we receive personal information about you from a third party, we will protect it as set out in this privacy policy. If you are a third party providing personal information about somebody else, you represent and warrant that you have such person’s consent to provide the personal information to us. </p>
<p>If you have previously agreed to Me using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time. We will provide you with the ability to unsubscribe from our email-database or opt out of communications. Please be aware we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. </p>
<p>If you believe that any information I hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please contact Me using the details provided in this privacy policy. I will take reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, or out of date. </p>
<p>If you believe that I have breached a relevant data protection law and wish to make a complaint, please contact Me using the details below and provide Me with full details of the alleged breach. I will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps I will take to deal with your complaint. You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or data protection authority in relation to your complaint. </p>
<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>I use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information about you and your activity across My site. A cookie is a small piece of data that My website stores on your computer, and accesses each time you visit, so I can understand how you use My site. This helps Me serve you content based on preferences you have specified. </p>
<h3>Limits of Our Policy</h3>
<p>My website may link to external sites that are not operated by Me. Please be aware that I have no control over the content and policies of those sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices. </p>
